## 🧭 About Me

I’m a full stack developer with more than seven years of work in Java and web applications.  
I build reliable systems that connect clear backend logic with fast, easy-to-use front-end interfaces.  
My focus is on **Spring Boot**, **ReactJS**, and **cloud deployment** using **AWS** and **Docker**.  
I enjoy improving performance, reducing manual steps, and writing code that is clean and simple to maintain.  
Outside of code, I read about new tools, small automation ideas, and how teams can build software with less complexity.
